Sport Relation API is an API to learn similarities between different sports and get a suggestion from API.

API is developed with Django Framework, and it uses PostgreSQL DBMS. Also, It uses [Decathlon API](https://developers.decathlon.com/products/sports/docs).

There are three capabilities of API.

1. You can fetch a detailed sport information with a sport `pk`
2. You can learn top 5 similar sports to a sport by giving a sport `pk`
3. You can get a suggestion from API to learn which sport is the most relevant sport for you by giving three sports you interested in.

API has a user interface which developed with help of html templates rendering by Django. You can interact with API with help of UI.
